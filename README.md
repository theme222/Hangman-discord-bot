# Hello Node (blank)

This is a discord bot for playing hangman

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That’s this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

← `index.js`: The thing that's running the code (duh)

← `hangbot.js`: some extra functions like posting embeds and getting words
